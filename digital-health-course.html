                    <strong>Credits: 1 point</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course you will learn to design novel engineering and business
                    solutions to some of the most pressing challenges encountered in modern healthcare.
                    The course is a running collaboration between the Technion, Cornell Tech, MindState<sup>1</sup> ,
                    and leading Israeli medical centers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The course is open to graduate students and also to outstanding
                    undergraduate students (סטודנטים מצטיינים) with approval of the course instructor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mixed teams of Technion and Cornell Tech students will collaborate during the semester. Students
                    will propose and prototype a solution that involves engineering and product development, accompanied
                    by a business strategy for possible commercialization. The course will finish with an Ideation
                    Hackathon. The major highlights of this course are:

                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Focus on Human Health</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Mixed team Technion-Cornell Tech</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>The Ideation Hackathon</li>
                </ul>

                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                    This year’s projects will focus on creating digital health solutions to address the various
                    challenges in healthcare, including:
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>The aging population</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Continuity of care in the home</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Accessibility and personalization of healthcare
                        records</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Housekeeping/bed turnover</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                    The course has two aims:
                <ul>
                    <li> <i>1. </i> To understand the opportunities of digital health in addressing medical challenges
                        and</li>
                    <li> <i>2. </i> To learn how to work in a cross-cultural and cross-functional team to suggest and
                        prototype a solution to the challenge at hand</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                    The course will include an initial meeting where the students will be exposed to a set of healthcare
                    challenges. Students will rank their project choices and joint Technion-Cornell teams will be formed
                    based on rankings and skillset. Students will visit partnering medical centers during a day long
                    tour which will include meeting with medical staff facing the challenge of their specific project.
                    Prior to this visit, the student teams must work closely with their Cornell Tech counterparts to
                    align the objectives and potential outcomes of the visit.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                    Teams will then conduct research to inform potential solutions to their challenge up to the end of
                    the course in December.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This course is highly collaborative and mostly team-managed that involves team members located in
                    different parts of the world. It is expected that work, research, and team meetings (including
                    concept presentations) are primarily completed outside of typical work and school hours. Students
                    are expected to communicate and involve every team member in team decisions. Staff will do its best
                    to schedule live meetings at the most optimal times.
                </p>


                <br />
                <p>
                    Following the course, students will be automatically included in the <a
                        href="https://www.mindstate-project.com/">MindState</a> Ideation Hackathon Program. This 3-day
                    event will combine Technion students with participants from Cornell Tech in New York, Tel Aviv
                    University, Health-Tech Venture Investors, and Design Professionals. These teams will compete to
                    create practical and innovative solutions to these medical problems. A few of the Judges for the
                    competition as well as program mentors include: Israel Coronavirus Czar and President of Ichilov
                    Medical Center, Professor Ronni Gamzu, the WHO European Medical Director, Dr. Dorit Nitzan and
                    leading angel investors.
                </p>


                <br />
                <p>
                    The winning team is expected to receive prizes that could include cash prizes, exclusive meetings
                    with VC firms to further develop their idea, premium subscriptions to software related to their
                    solution, and/or travel grants to Cornell Tech – all dependent on availability of funds at the time
                    of the competition.
                </p>


                <br />
                <p>
                    Past winners went on to receive pre-seed to jumpstart their venture into real solutions for medical
                    institutions around the world. Others, had been considered for an opportunity to implement their
                    solution at Ichilov Medical Center.
