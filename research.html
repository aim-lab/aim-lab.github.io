                            With billions of mobile devices worldwide, the low cost of mobile-connected medical
                            sensors,
                            and the widespread availability and use of medical imaging apparatuses,
                            recording and transmitting medical data has become easier than ever.

                            However, this ‘wealth’ of medical data has had limited success in providing novel
                            actionable
                            clinical information to improve patient care within and outside the traditional clinical
                            environment.

                            This is due to the lack of robust intelligent algorithms that can exploit the
                            information encrypted within these ‘big databases’ of physiological time-series
                            and medical images and take individual variability into account.

                            Exploiting these datasets necessitates an in-depth understanding of the physiology
                            underlying the patterns present in the medical time series and images,
                            and use of advanced digital signal processing and machine learning (ML)

                                Sleep is essential for human health, well-being, and longevity. 
								Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality are known to cause a myriad of physical and mental diseases such as
								cardiovascular disease, obesity and depression. Sleep disorders are highly prevalent, affecting up to one-sixth 
								of the global adult population. Furthermore, during sleep individuals remains more still than during wakefulness. 
								This enables hours of data acquisition with reduced noise, overall providing longer recordings. 
								The long and quality recordings may then be automatically analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms to 
								identify patterns of sleep or other diseases. This means, sleep can be regarded as a ‘testbed’ for physiological 
								functions. We recently coined this paradigm ‘medicine during sleep’. We hypothesized that some conditions may be 
								better expressed during sleep thus providing an added prognosis value. Therefore, sleep may be a particularly 
								suitable time for performing diagnosis and monitoring of conditions such as some cardiovascular and respiratory 
								diseases. Consequently, this research focuses on the development of artificial intelligence algorithms trained on 
								large databases for the purpose of remote diagnosis and monitoring of sleep and other conditions by leveraging long 
								term physiological time series recorded overnight.
                            </p>
                            <!--p>
                                We hypothesize that some conditions may be better expressed during sleep thus
                                providing an added prognosis value.
                                Therefore, sleep may be a particularly suitable time for performing diagnosis and
                                monitoring of many conditions,
                                such as some cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
                                Indeed, if disease-specific physiological patterns manifesting during sleep are
                                identified,
                                these may be leveraged to perform diagnosis and monitoring of medical conditions
                                while sleeping.
                                In addition, during sleep individuals remains more still than during wakefulness.
                                This enables hours of data acquirement with reduced noise, overall providing longer
                                recordings.
                                The long and quality recordings may then be automatically analyzed by artificial
                                intelligence (AI)
                                algorithms to identify patterns of health and disease.
                                This means, sleep can be regarded as a ‘testbed’ for physiological functions.
                                This paradigm, recently coined ‘medicine during sleep’ (Behar 2020), is the topic of
                                this research axis.

                                We focus our research on this new paradigm in how diagnosis and monitoring of human
                                health may be performed during sleep.
                                It aims to encourage novel and creative ways to assess human health during sleep for
                                any medical condition.

                                Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart arrhythmia. 
								It is associated with a 5-fold increase in stroke incidence and a 3.5-fold mortality risk increase. 
								Across ethnicities, ages and sexes AF has been reported to have varying prevalence. 
								A recent Swedish study reported on 89 out of 908 (9%) false positive automated misdiagnoses of AF, 
								with almost half of these cases not corrected by the overreading primary-care physician, 
								sometimes leading to inappropriate treatment with anticoagulant therapy. 
								Machine learning presents a unique opportunity to provide an accurate automated diagnosis of AF. 
								Yet, these models must demonstrate generalizability to external datasets integrating a range of 
								population samples. This research intends to develop new machine learning models to support risk 
								prediction and the diagnosis of AF from long term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.

                                According to the National Center for Health Statistics, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 
								including coronary heart disease and stroke, are the most common cause of death in the USA. 
								Research has shown that retinal microvascular abnormalities are present in CVD. 
								Retinal vasculature can be non-invasively assessed using digital fundus images (DFI), 
								which can be easily obtained using a fundus camera. Consequently, retinal vascular features 
								obtained from DFI may be used to characterize and analyze vascular health. 
								In order to clinical machine learning decision support system, it is necessary to fully automate 
								the computation of these biomarkers from the segmented vasculature. Accordingly, this research aims to 
								develop machine learning algorithms to segment the vasculatures of DFI (venules and arterioles), 
								engineer vasculature biomarkers and models that can diagnose or risk predict the occurrence of a CVD.

                            <br />

                            <p>
                                To date, the field of sleep medicine has focused on the diagnosis of sleep disorders
                                as defined
                                in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3).
                                Among those, due to its high prevalence, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often the
                                main focus,
                                sometimes the sole interest of clinically working sleep centers.
                                Yet, although we spend, on average, one third of our time sleeping,
                                less research has been invested in characterizing how non-sleep-specific diseases
                                manifest during sleep.
                                These ‘secondary sleep disorders’ are mentioned specifically in the ICSD-3.
                                Indeed, diseases regulation and expression during sleep might differ significantly
                                than during wakefulness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We hypothesize that some conditions may be better expressed during sleep thus
                                providing an added prognosis value.
                                Therefore, sleep may be a particularly suitable time for performing diagnosis and
                                monitoring of many conditions,
                                such as some cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
                                Indeed, if disease-specific physiological patterns manifesting during sleep are
                                identified,
                                these may be leveraged to perform diagnosis and monitoring of medical conditions
                                while sleeping.
                                In addition, during sleep individuals remains more still than during wakefulness.
                                This enables hours of data acquirement with reduced noise, overall providing longer
                                recordings.
                                The long and quality recordings may then be automatically analyzed by artificial
                                intelligence (AI)
                                algorithms to identify patterns of health and disease.
                                This means, sleep can be regarded as a ‘testbed’ for physiological functions.
                                This paradigm, recently coined ‘medicine during sleep’ (Behar 2020), is the topic of
                                this research axis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We focus our research on this new paradigm in how diagnosis and monitoring of human
                                health may be performed during sleep.
                                It aims to encourage novel and creative ways to assess human health during sleep for
                                any medical condition.

                                Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, with a prevalence of 0.95%
                                among the adult population. It is associated with quivering or irregular heartbeat,
                                that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related
                                complications. The currently accepted convention for AF diagnosis is the presence of
                                an episode lasting at least 30 seconds. It has been shown that further
                                characterization of the condition over longer intervals, lasting from hours to days,
                                may improve phenotyping of the diseases, and some recent research has started
                                investigating the regularity and length of AF events across individuals. In
                                addition, because a large proportion of AF individuals present paroxysmal AF this
                                means that long recordings must be performed to accurately diagnose them. This
                                motivates performing long-term continuous electrophysiological recording for the
                                purpose of robust AF diagnosis. On the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, AF is
                                characterized by an irregular heart rate and by the absence of p-wave. Today, ECG
                                may be recorded using a single portable channel such as the Zio patch (iRhythm, San
                                Francisco). We aim to develop advanced ML approaches to accurately diagnose AF from
                                hours long recordings of a single channel ECG time series and better phenotype
                                patients using unsupervised learning.

                                recent advances in deep learning and applied to AF personalized diagnosis and
                                treatment. The outcome may result in a set of algorithms that can translate to the
                                clinical practice and significantly decrease morbidity and mortality associated with
                                AF. Given the high prevalence of AF (0.95% among the adult population), the impact
                                of such new technology may be significant.

                                The US records 26,000 fetal death each year. Half of all stillbirths are caused by
                                pregnancy
                                disorders and conditions affecting the placenta.
                                The aim of antenatal fetal surveillance is to identify fetuses at risk of
                                intrauterine hypoxia and academia.
                                Timely, appropriate intervention will avoid fetal neurological damage or death.
                                Currently, women with at risk pregnancy must go to the hospital daily for assessing
                                the fetal wellbeing.
                                This is stressful for the women and sometime impossible because of the lack of local
                                specialized center.

                                The aim of this research is to elaborate a portable fetal monitor based on
                                non-invasive fetal
                                electrocardiography (Holter NI-FECG). Such a monitor can be used for regular remote
                                assessment
                                of fetal health in pregnancies at risk or to follow-up on treatments. The
                                elaboration of a
                                NI-FECG Holter device will offer new opportunities for fetal diagnosis and remote
                                monitoring
                                of problematic pregnancies because of its low-cost, non-invasiveness, portability
                                and minimal
                                set-up requirements. Specifically, this research aims to:
