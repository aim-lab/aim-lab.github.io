                        <p>
                            With billions of mobile devices worldwide, the low cost of mobile-connected medical
                            sensors,
                            and the widespread availability and use of medical imaging apparatuses,
                            recording and transmitting medical data has become easier than ever.

                            However, this ‘wealth’ of medical data has had limited success in providing novel
                            actionable
                            clinical information to improve patient care within and outside the traditional clinical
                            environment.

                            This is due to the lack of robust intelligent algorithms that can exploit the
                            information encrypted within these ‘big databases’ of physiological time-series
                            and medical images and take individual variability into account.

                            Exploiting these datasets necessitates an in-depth understanding of the physiology
                            underlying the patterns present in the medical time series and images,
                            and use of advanced digital signal processing and machine learning (ML)
                            tools (e.g., deep learning) to recognize and extract patterns
                            characteristic of health function in order to translate these
                            patterns into clinically actionable information.

                                in China and then across the globe. Millions of individuals have been contaminated
                                and hundred of thousands have died because of it. The clinical spectrum of

                                    <i class="text-muted large h5">A data-driven paradigm change</i>
                                </div>

                            <br />

                            <p>
                                To date, the field of sleep medicine has focused on the diagnosis of sleep disorders
                                as defined
                                in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3).
                                Among those, due to its high prevalence, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often the
                                main focus,
                                sometimes the sole interest of clinically working sleep centers.
                                Yet, although we spend, on average, one third of our time sleeping,
                                less research has been invested in characterizing how non-sleep-specific diseases
                                manifest during sleep.
                                These ‘secondary sleep disorders’ are mentioned specifically in the ICSD-3.
                                Indeed, diseases regulation and expression during sleep might differ significantly
                                than during wakefulness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We hypothesize that some conditions may be better expressed during sleep thus
                                providing an added prognosis value.
                                Therefore, sleep may be a particularly suitable time for performing diagnosis and
                                monitoring of many conditions,
                                such as some cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
                                Indeed, if disease-specific physiological patterns manifesting during sleep are
                                identified,
                                these may be leveraged to perform diagnosis and monitoring of medical conditions
                                while sleeping.
                                In addition, during sleep individuals remains more still than during wakefulness.
                                This enables hours of data acquirement with reduced noise, overall providing longer
                                recordings.
                                The long and quality recordings may then be automatically analyzed by artificial
                                intelligence (AI)
                                algorithms to identify patterns of health and disease.
                                This means, sleep can be regarded as a ‘testbed’ for physiological functions.
                                This paradigm, recently coined ‘medicine during sleep’ (Behar 2020), is the topic of
                                this research axis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We focus our research on this new paradigm in how diagnosis and monitoring of human
                                health may be performed during sleep.
                                It aims to encourage novel and creative ways to assess human health during sleep for
                                any medical condition.

                                Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, with a prevalence of 0.95%
                                among the adult population. It is associated with quivering or irregular heartbeat,
                                that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related
                                complications. The currently accepted convention for AF diagnosis is the presence of
                                an episode lasting at least 30 seconds. It has been shown that further
                                characterization of the condition over longer intervals, lasting from hours to days,
                                may improve phenotyping of the diseases, and some recent research has started
                                investigating the regularity and length of AF events across individuals. In
                                addition, because a large proportion of AF individuals present paroxysmal AF this
                                means that long recordings must be performed to accurately diagnose them. This
                                motivates performing long-term continuous electrophysiological recording for the
                                purpose of robust AF diagnosis. On the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, AF is
                                characterized by an irregular heart rate and by the absence of p-wave. Today, ECG
                                may be recorded using a single portable channel such as the Zio patch (iRhythm, San
                                Francisco). We aim to develop advanced ML approaches to accurately diagnose AF from
                                hours long recordings of a single channel ECG time series and better phenotype
                                patients using unsupervised learning.

                                This research is expected to contribute novel algorithms drawing from the most
                                recent advances in deep learning and applied to AF personalized diagnosis and
                                treatment. The outcome may result in a set of algorithms that can translate to the
                                clinical practice and significantly decrease morbidity and mortality associated with
                                AF. Given the high prevalence of AF (0.95% among the adult population), the impact
                                of such new technology may be significant.

                                The US records 26,000 fetal death each year. Half of all stillbirths are caused by
                                pregnancy
                                disorders and conditions affecting the placenta.
                                The aim of antenatal fetal surveillance is to identify fetuses at risk of
                                intrauterine hypoxia and academia.
                                Timely, appropriate intervention will avoid fetal neurological damage or death.
                                Currently, women with at risk pregnancy must go to the hospital daily for assessing
                                the fetal wellbeing.
                                This is stressful for the women and sometime impossible because of the lack of local
                                specialized center.
