                                    <h5>Commitments:</h5>
                                    <p>You agree to work on your research project within the period of time that was agreed with your supervisor. Typically, two years for an MSc and four years for a PhD position. Following the end of the research project you may be requested to support the submission and handling of a publication on your research. You commit to support the handling of such paper while it is understood and here-stated that this should not impair any new responsibility you have taken in your next job.</p>
                                    <h5>Type of works:</h5>
                                    <p>Working on your thesis is somewhat similar to working in a startup: you will have to work on different aspect of your project. This may include data collection, data curation, coding and writing reports/papers. You are expected to work on these different tasks as much as needed to move your project forward.</p>
                                    <h5>Non-disclosure:</h5>
                                    <p>You commit not to share, email or publicly present any of your work or lab related work, documents and data without the agreement of your supervisor. Your source code should be stored on private GIT repository during the research period. Whether to release it as open source or license it will be decided by your supervisor at the point where milestones have been reached and the code is in a mature state.</p>
                                    <h5>Responsiveness:</h5>
                                    <p>It is required that you respond to your supervisor emails within a descent amount of time. In a normal period, this means within two days. Failure to keep your supervisor updated for too long may results in decision being made without your approval such as publishing your work or the project being aborted.</p>
                                    <h5>Data protection:</h5>
                                    <p>The AIMLab. is working with anonymized medical data. Despite these data being anonymized it is forbidden to share them with anyone outside the laboratory because of their sensitive type. It is preferable that these data be solely stored on the faculty servers and be accessed and processed via ssh.</p>
