                                <h5>Commitments:</h5>
                                <p>You agree to work on your research project within the period of time that was
                                    agreed with your supervisor. Typically, two years for an MSc and four years for
                                    a PhD position. Following the end of the research project you may be requested
                                    to support the submission and handling of a publication on your research. You
                                    commit to support the handling of such paper while it is understood and
                                    here-stated that this should not impair any new responsibility you have taken in
                                    your next job.</p>
                                <h5>Type of works:</h5>
                                <p>Working on your thesis is somewhat similar to working in a startup: you will have
                                    to work on different aspect of your project. This may include data collection,
                                    data curation, coding and writing reports/papers. You are expected to work on
                                    these different tasks as much as needed to move your project forward.</p>
                                <h5>Non-disclosure:</h5>
                                <p>You commit not to share, email or publicly present any of your work or lab
                                    related work, documents and data without the agreement of your supervisor. Your
                                    source code should be stored on private GIT repository during the research
                                    period. Whether to release it as open source or license it will be decided by
                                    your supervisor at the point where milestones have been reached and the code is
                                    in a mature state.</p>
                                <h5>Responsiveness:</h5>
                                <p>It is required that you respond to your supervisor emails within a descent amount
                                    of time. In a normal period, this means within two days. Failure to keep your
                                    supervisor updated for too long may results in decision being made without your
                                    approval such as publishing your work or the project being aborted.</p>
                                <h5>Data protection:</h5>
                                <p>The AIMLab. is working with anonymized medical data. Despite these data being
                                    anonymized it is forbidden to share them with anyone outside the laboratory
                                    because of their sensitive type. It is preferable that these data be solely
                                    stored on the faculty servers and be accessed and processed via ssh.</p>
                                <h5>Absence from Technion</h5>
                                <p>A student who receives a scholarship for the entire academic year (October â€“
                                    September), is entitled to a one month vacation per year (with no accumulation),
                                    out of which two weeks at most during August and September. Any vacation /
                                    absence of scholarship recipients, in Israel and abroad, has to be preapproved.
